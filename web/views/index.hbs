    <p class="index-info">
        Moderari Empire is a Discord Community, but unlike any other.. <br><br>
        The Moderari Empire is much like a real society with a hint of dictatorship.
        By doing good things (following rules, contributing to the community) you'll achieve a higher social status, with a possible rank/role.
        however, doing bad things (Being a dick, cursing at our beloveded leader) will lead to you being spit at and trashed by the community.
        The Server has multiple layers to indicate the good, the bad and the better. Being a good lad you'll go up to a higher layer.
        Each layer has new perks and new people. By reaching the second layer you'll get access to some of the community gaming servers (MC, GMod, ect).
